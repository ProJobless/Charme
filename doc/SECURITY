TODO:

* **Sign Lists:** Currently the server can return additional People for a list. So the server can return some person he knows the private key and read the message posted in an encrypted collection
* Messages: MITM attack can start conversation as only public key is needed for that
* Edgekeys: Prevent sending old key revisions! Check key Revisions beforehand! Delete old public keys from localkeydir!
* Recrypt edgekey: can server return additional posts?
* Server can return wrong public keys or userIds/usernames when starting new conversations: Solution: encrypt username/userid with fastkey1 and check for userId == decryptedPubKey.userId
* stream_respond: Only respond posts containing audience field if search initated by person in audience field (Signature Check!)
* how to check that messagekey is the newest one?

* encrypt username and userid of users in keydir with fastkey1
* Login: Evil server could return no hash value and get unhashed password via rainbow table. Critical as unhashed password used to en/decrypt passphrase for login
