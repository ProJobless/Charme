- replace IP address with server url in asynchtttp
- keepp user logged in if user is logged out...


Known issues
- java.io.FileNotFoundException: http://localhost:9000/charme/req.php
- may relate to error 400 and above, not only 404!
- always check the apache logs first when something is not working


### Option 2 : Port forwarding:
- Idea: Redirect localhost:9000 on device to localhost on pc:
